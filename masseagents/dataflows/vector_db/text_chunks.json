  "Climatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nDivision B\nAppendix C\nClimatic and Seismic Information for\nBuilding Design in British Columbia\nIntroduction\nThe great diversity of climate in British Columbia has a considerable effect on the performance of buildings; consequently, \nbuilding design must reflect this diversity. This Appendix briefly describes how climatic design values are computed and provides \nrecommended design data for a number of cities, towns, and lesser populated locations. Through the use of such data, appropriate \nallowances can be made for climate variations in different localities of British Columbia and the British Columbia Building Code \ncan be applied regionally.\nThe climatic design data presented in Table\u00a0C-2 are based on weather observations collected by the Atmospheric Environment \nService, Environment Canada. The data were researched and analyzed by Environment Canada.\nAs it is not practical to list values for all municipalities in British Columbia, recommended climatic design values for locations not \nlisted can be obtained by contacting the Atmospheric Environment Service, Environment Canada, 4905 Dufferin\u00a0Street, \nDownsview, Ontario M3H\u00a05T4, (416)\u00a0739-4365. It should be noted, however, that these recommended values may differ from \nthe legal requirements set by local government building authorities.\nThe information on seismic hazard in spectral format given in Table\u00a0C-3 has been provided by the Geological Survey of Canada \nof Natural Resources Canada. Information for municipalities not listed can be obtained at www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca or \nby writing to the Geological Survey of Canada at 7 Observatory Crescent, Ottawa, Ontario K1A\u00a00Y3, or at P.O.\u00a0Box\u00a06000, \nSidney,\u00a0B.C. V8L\u00a04B2.\nGeneral\nThe choice of climatic elements tabulated in this Appendix and the form in which they are expressed have been dictated largely by \nthe requirements for specific values in several sections of this Code. These elements include the Ground Snow Loads, Wind \nPressures, Design Temperatures, Heating Degree-Days, One-Day and 15-Minute Rainfalls, the Annual Total Precipitation values \nand Seismic Data. The following notes briefly explain the significance of these particular elements in building design, and\u00a0indicate \nwhich weather observations were used and how they were analyzed to yield the required design values.\nTable\u00a0C-2 lists design weather recommendations and elevations for over 100\u00a0locations, which have been chosen based on a variety \nof reasons. Many incorporated cities and towns with significant populations are included unless located close to larger cities. \nFor sparsely populated areas, many smaller towns and villages are listed. Other locations have been added to the list when the \ndemand for climatic design recommendations at these sites has been significant. The named locations refer to the specific latitude \nand longitude defined by the Gazetteer of Canada (Natural Resources Canada), available from Publishing and Depository \nServices Canada, Public Works and Government Services Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A\u00a00S5. The elevations are given in metres \nand refer to heights above sea level.\nAlmost all of the weather observations used in preparing Table\u00a0C-2 were, of necessity, observed at inhabited locations. \nTo estimate design values for arbitrary locations, the observed or computed values for the weather stations were mapped and \ninterpolated appropriately. Where possible, adjustments have been applied for the influence of elevation and known \ntopographical effects. Such\u00a0influences include the tendency of cold air to collect in depressions, for precipitation to increase with \nelevation, and for generally stronger winds near large bodies of water. Elevations have been added to Table\u00a0C-2 because of their \npotential to significantly influence climatic design values.\nSince interpolation from the values in Table\u00a0C-2 to other locations may not be valid due to local and other effects, Environment \nCanada will provide climatic design element recommendations for locations not listed in Table\u00a0C-2. Local effects are particularly \nsignificant in mountainous areas, where the values apply only to populated valleys and not to the mountain slopes and high \npasses, where very different conditions are known to exist.\nChanging and Variable Climates\nClimate is not static. At any location, weather and climatic conditions vary from season to season, year to year, and over longer \ntime periods (climate cycles). This has always been the case. In fact, evidence is mounting that the climates of Canada are \nchanging and will continue to change significantly into future. When estimating climatic design loads, this variability can be \nconsidered using appropriate statistical analysis, data records spanning sufficient periods, and meteorological judgement. \nThe\u00a0analysis generally assumes that the past climate will be representative of the future climate.\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nPast and ongoing modifications to atmospheric chemistry (from greenhouse gas emissions and land use changes) are expected to \nalter most climatic regimes in the future despite the success of the most ambitious greenhouse gas mitigation plans.(1) \nSome regions could see an increase in the frequency and intensity of many weather extremes, which will accelerate weathering \nprocesses. Consequently, many buildings will need to be designed, maintained and operated to adequately withstand ever \nchanging climatic loads.\nSimilar to global trends, the last decade in Canada was noted as the warmest in instrumented record. Canada has warmed, on \naverage, at almost twice the rate of the global average increase, while the western Arctic is warming at a rate that is unprecedented \nover the past 400\u00a0years.(1) Mounting evidence",

Consequently, many buildings will need to be designed, maintained and operated to adequately withstand ever \nchanging climatic loads.\nSimilar to global trends, the last decade in Canada was noted as the warmest in instrumented record. Canada has warmed, on \naverage, at almost twice the rate of the global average increase, while the western Arctic is warming at a rate that is unprecedented \nover the past 400\u00a0years.(1) Mounting evidence from Arctic communities indicates that rapid changes to climate in the North have \nresulted in melting permafrost and impacts from other climate changes have affected nearly every type of built structure. \nFurthermore, analyses of Canadian precipitation data shows that many regions of the country have, on average, also been tending \ntowards wetter conditions.(1) In the United States, where the density of climate monitoring stations is greater, a number of studies \nhave found an unambiguous upward trend in the frequency of heavy to extreme precipitation events, with these increases \ncoincident with a general upward trend in the total amount of precipitation. Climate change model results, based on an ensemble \nof global climate models worldwide, project that future climate warming rates will be greatest in higher latitude countries such \nas Canada.(2)\nJanuary Design Temperatures\nA building and its heating system should be designed to maintain the inside temperature at some pre-determined level. To\u00a0achieve \nthis, it is necessary to know the most severe weather conditions under which the system will be expected to function satisfactorily. \nFailure to maintain the inside temperature at the pre-determined level will not usually be serious if the temperature drop is not \ngreat and if the duration is not long. The outside conditions used for design should, therefore, not be the most severe in many \nyears, but\u00a0should be the somewhat less severe conditions that are occasionally but not greatly exceeded. \nThe January design temperatures are based on an analysis of January air temperatures only. Wind and solar radiation also affect \nthe inside temperature of most buildings and may need to be considered for energy-efficient design. \nThe January design temperature is defined as the lowest temperature at or below which only a certain small percentage of the \nhourly outside air temperatures in January occur. In the past, a total of 158\u00a0stations with records from all or part of the period \n1951-66 formed the basis for calculation of the 2.5 and 1% January temperatures. Where necessary, the data were adjusted for \nconsistency. Since most of the temperatures were observed at airports, design values for the core areas of large cities could be 1\u00a0or \n2\u00b0C milder, although the values for the outlying areas are probably about the same as for the airports. No adjustments were made \nfor this urban island heat effect. The design values for the next 20\u00a0to\u00a030 years will probably differ from these tabulated values due \nto year-to-year climate variability and global climate change resulting from the impact of human activities on atmospheric \nchemistry.\nThe design temperatures were reviewed and updated using hourly temperature observations from 480\u00a0stations for a 25-year \nperiod up to 2006 with at least 8\u00a0years of complete data. These data are consistent with data shown for Canadian locations in the \n2009 Handbook of Fundamentals(3) published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning \nEngineers (ASHRAE). The most recent 25\u00a0years of record were used to provide a balance between accounting for trends in the \nclimate and the sampling variation owing to year-to-year variation. The 1% and 2.5% values used for the design conditions \nrepresent percentiles of the cumulative frequency distribution of hourly temperatures and correspond to January temperatures \nthat are colder for 8 and 19\u00a0hours, respectively, on average over the long term.\nThe 2.5% January design temperature is the value ordinarily used in the design of heating systems. In special cases, when\u00a0the \ncontrol of inside temperature is more critical, the 1% value may be used. Other temperature-dependent climatic design \nparameters may be considered for future issues of this document. \nJuly Design Temperatures\nA building and its cooling and dehumidifying system should be designed to maintain the inside temperature and humidity at \ncertain pre-determined levels. To achieve this, it is necessary to know the most severe weather conditions under which the system \nis expected to function satisfactorily. Failure to maintain the inside temperature and humidity at the pre-determined levels will \nusually not be serious if the increases in temperature and humidity are not great and the duration is not long. The outside \nconditions used for design should, therefore, not be the most severe in many years, but should be the somewhat less severe \nconditions that are occasionally but not greatly exceeded. \nThe summer design temperatures in this Appendix are based on an analysis of July air temperatures and humidities. Wind and \nsolar radiation also affect the inside temperature of most buildings and may, in some cases, be more important than the outside air \ntemperature. More complete summer and winter design information can be obtained from Environment Canada.\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nDivision B\nThe July design dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures were reviewed and updated using hourly temperature observations from \n480\u00a0stations for a 25-year period up to 2006.

  " Code 2018\nDivision B\nThe July design dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures were reviewed and updated using hourly temperature observations from \n480\u00a0stations for a 25-year period up to 2006. These data are consistent with data shown for Canadian locations in the \n2009 Handbook of Fundamentals(3) published by ASHRAE. As with January design temperatures, data from the most recent \n25-year period were analyzed to reflect any recent climatic changes or variations. The 2.5% values used for the dry- and wet-bulb \ndesign conditions represent percentiles of the cumulative frequency distribution of hourly dry- and wet-bulb temperatures and \ncorrespond to July temperatures that are higher for 19\u00a0hours on average over the long term.\nHeating Degree-Days\nThe rate of consumption of fuel or energy required to keep the interior of a small building at 21\u00b0C when the outside air \ntemperature is below 18\u00b0C is roughly proportional to the difference between 18\u00b0C and the outside temperature. Wind speed, solar \nradiation, the\u00a0extent to which the building is exposed to these elements and the internal heat sources also affect the heat required \nand may have to be considered for energy-efficient design. For average conditions of wind, radiation, exposure, and\u00a0internal \nsources, however, the\u00a0proportionality with the temperature difference generally still holds.\nSince the fuel required is also proportional to the duration of the cold weather, a convenient method of combining these elements \nof temperature and time is to add the differences between 18\u00b0C and the mean temperature for every day in the year when the \nmean temperature is below 18\u00b0C. It is assumed that no heat is required when the mean outside air temperature for the day is 18\u00b0C \nor higher.\nAlthough more sophisticated computer simulations using other forms of weather data have now almost completely replaced \ndegree-day-based calculation methods for estimating annual heating energy consumption, degree-days remain a useful indicator \nof relative severity of climate and can form the basis for certain climate-related Code requirements.\nThe degree-days below 18\u00b0C were compiled for 1 300\u00a0stations for the 25-year period ending in 2006. This analysis period is \nconsistent with the one used to derive the design temperatures described above and with the approach used by ASHRAE.(3)\nA difference of only one Celsius degree in the mean annual temperature will cause a difference of 250 to 350 in the Celsius \ndegree-days. Since differences of 0.5 of a Celsius degree in the mean annual temperature are quite likely to occur between two \nstations in the same town, heating degree-days cannot be relied on to an accuracy of less than about 100\u00a0degree-days.\nHeating degree-day values for the core areas of larger cities can be 200 to 400\u00a0degree-days less (warmer) than for the surrounding \nfringe areas. The observed degree-days, which are based on daily temperature observations, are often most representative of rural \nsettings or the fringe areas of cities.\nClimatic Data for Energy Consumption Calculations\nThe climatic elements tabulated in this Appendix represent commonly used design values but do not include detailed climatic \nprofiles, such as hourly weather data. Where hourly values of weather data are needed for the purpose of simulating the annual \nenergy consumption of a building, they can be obtained from multiple sources, such as Environment Canada, Natural Resources \nCanada, the Regional Conservation Authority and other such public agencies that record this information. Hourly weather data \nare also available from public and private agencies that format this information for use with annual energy consumption \nsimulation software; in some cases, these data have been incorporated into the software.\nSnow Loads\nThe roof of a building should be able to support the greatest weight of snow that is likely to accumulate on it in many years. \nSome observations of snow on roofs have been made in Canada, but not enough to form the basis for estimating roof snow loads \nthroughout the country. Similarly, observations of the weight, or water equivalent, of the snow on the ground have not been \navailable in digital form in the past. The observations of roof loads and water equivalents are very useful, as noted below, but the \nmeasured depth of snow on the ground is used to provide the basic information for a consistent set of snow loads.\nThe estimation of the design snow load on a roof from snow depth observations involves the following steps:\n1. The depth of snow on the ground, which has an annual probability of exceedance of 1-in-50, is computed.\n2. The appropriate unit weight is selected and used to convert snow depth to loads, Ss.\n3. The load, Sr, which is due to rain falling on the snow, is computed.\n4. Because the accumulation of snow on roofs is often different from that on the ground, adjustments are applied to the ground \nsnow load to provide a design snow load on a roof.\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nThe annual maximum depth of snow on the ground has been assembled for 1 618\u00a0stations for which data has been recorded by \nthe Atmospheric Environment Service (AES). The period of record used varied from station to station, ranging from 7 to \n38\u00a0years. These\u00a0data were analyzed using a Gumbel extreme value distribution fitted using the method of moments(4) as reported \nby Newark et\u00a0al.(5) The resulting values are the snow depths, which have a probability of 1-in-50 of being exceeded in any \none year.\nThe unit weight of old snow generally ranges from 2 to 5\u00a0kN/m3, and it is usually",

These\u00a0data were analyzed using a Gumbel extreme value distribution fitted using the method of moments(4) as reported \nby Newark et\u00a0al.(5) The resulting values are the snow depths, which have a probability of 1-in-50 of being exceeded in any \none year.\nThe unit weight of old snow generally ranges from 2 to 5\u00a0kN/m3, and it is usually assumed in Canada that 1\u00a0kN/m3 is the average \nfor new snow. Average unit weights of the seasonal snow pack have been derived for different regions across the country(6) and an \nappropriate value has been assigned to each weather station. Typically, the values average 2.01\u00a0kN/m3 east of the continental \ndivide (except for 2.94\u00a0kN/m3 north of the treeline), and range from 2.55 to 4.21\u00a0kN/m3 west of the divide. The product of the \n1-in-50 snow depth and the average unit weight of the seasonal snow pack at a station is converted to the snow load (SL) in units \nof kilopascals (kPa).\nExcept for the mountainous areas of western Canada, the values of the ground snow load at AES stations were normalized \nassuming a linear variation of the load above sea level in order to account for the effects of topography. They were then smoothed \nusing an uncertainty-weighted moving-area average in order to minimize the uncertainty due to snow depth sampling errors and \nsite-specific variations. Interpolation from analyzed maps of the smooth normalized values yielded a value for each location in \nTable\u00a0C-2, which could then be converted to the listed code values (Ss) by means of an equation in the form:\nwhere b is the assumed rate of change of SL with elevation at the location and Z is the location\u2019s elevation above mean sea level \n(MSL). Although they are listed in Table\u00a0C-2 to the nearest tenth of a kilopascal, values of Ss typically have an uncertainty of \nabout 20%. Areas of sparse data in northern Canada were an exception to this procedure. In these regions, an analysis was made \nof the basic SL values. The effects of topography, variations due to local climates, and smoothing were all subjectively assessed. \nThe values derived in this fashion were used to modify those derived objectively.\nFor the mountainous areas of British Columbia, a more complex procedure was required to account for the variation of loads with \nterrain and elevation. Since the AES observational network often does not have sufficient coverage to detail this variability in \nmountainous areas, additional snow course observations were obtained from the provincial government of British Columbia. \nThe additional data allowed detailed local analysis of ground snow loads on a valley-by-valley basis. Similar to other studies, the \ndata indicated that snow loads above a critical or reference level increased according to either a linear or quadratic relation with \nelevation. The determination of whether the increase with elevation was linear or quadratic, the rate of the increase and the critical \nor reference elevation were found to be specific to the valley and mountain ranges considered. At valley levels below the critical \nelevation, the loads generally varied less significantly with elevation. Calculated valley- and range-specific regression relations were \nthen used to describe the increase of load with elevation and to normalize the AES snow observations to a critical or \nreference level. These normalized values were smoothed using a weighted moving-average.\nTabulated values cannot be expected to indicate all the local differences in Ss. For this reason, especially in complex terrain areas, \nvalues should not be interpolated from Table\u00a0C-2 for unlisted locations. The values of Ss in the Table apply for the elevation and \nthe latitude and longitude of the location, as defined by the Gazetteer of Canada. Values at other locations can be obtained from \nEnvironment Canada.\nThe heaviest loads frequently occur when the snow is wetted by rain, thus the rain load, Sr, was estimated to the nearest 0.1\u00a0kPa \nand is provided in Table\u00a0C-2. When values of Sr are added to Ss, this provides a 1-in-50-year estimate of the combined ground \nsnow and rain load. The values of Sr are based on an analysis of about 2 100 weather station values of the 1-in-50-year one-day \nmaximum rain amount. This return period is appropriate because the rain amounts correspond approximately to the joint \nfrequency of occurrence of the one-day rain on maximum snow packs. For the purpose of estimating rain on snow, the individual \nobserved one-day rain amounts were constrained to be less than or equal to the snow pack water equivalent, which was estimated \nby a snow pack accumulation model reported by Bruce and Clark.(7)\nThe results from surveys of snow loads on roofs indicate that average roof loads are generally less than loads on the ground. \nThe\u00a0conditions under which the design snow load on the roof may be taken as a percentage of the ground snow load are given in \nSubsection\u00a04.1.6. The Code also permits further decreases in design snow loads for steeply sloping roofs, but requires substantial \nincreases for roofs where snow accumulation may be more rapid due to such factors as drifting. Recommended adjustments are \ngiven in the \u201cUser\u2019s Guide \u2013 NBC 2015, Structural Commentaries (Part 4 of Division B).\u201d\nThe ground snow load values, Ss, were updated for this edition of the Code using a similar approach to the one used for the \nground snow load update in the 1990\u00a0NBC, which was the basis for the 1992 British Columbia Building Code.

The Gumbel \nextreme value distribution was fitted to the annual maxima of daily snow depth observations made at over 1 400 weather stations, \nwhich were compiled from 1990 onward \u2013 to as recently as 2012 for some stations \u2013 to calculate the 50-year return period \nSs \u0002 smooth normalized SL \u0003 bZ\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nDivision B\nsnow depth. The 50-year ground snow load was then calculated for each weather station by combining the 50-year snow pack \ndepth with the assigned snow pack density. The Ss values for each location in Table\u00a0C-2 were compared with the updated weather \nstation values and revised accordingly. \nAnnual Total Precipitation\nTotal precipitation is the sum in millimetres of the measured depth of rainwater and the estimated or measured water equivalent \nof the snow (typically estimated as\u00a00.1 of the measured depth of snow, since the average density of fresh snow is about\u00a00.1 that \nof water).\nThe average annual total precipitation amounts in Table\u00a0C-2 have been interpolated from an analysis of precipitation \nobservations from 1 379\u00a0stations for the 30-year period from 1961 to 1990.\nAnnual Rainfall\nThe total amount of rain that normally falls in one year is frequently used as a general indication of the wetness of a climate, and\u00a0is \ntherefore included in this Appendix. See also Moisture Index below.\nRainfall Intensity\nRoof drainage systems are designed to carry off rainwater from the most intense rainfall that is likely to occur. A certain amount of \ntime is required for the rainwater to flow across and down the roof before it enters the gutter or drainage system. This results in \nthe smoothing out of the most rapid changes in rainfall intensity. The drainage system, therefore, need only cope with the flow of \nrainwater produced by the average rainfall intensity over a period of a few minutes, which can be called the concentration time.\nIn Canada, it has been customary to use the 15-minute rainfall that will probably be exceeded on an average of once in 10\u00a0years. \nThe concentration time for small roofs is much less than 15\u00a0minutes and hence the design intensity will be exceeded more \nfrequently than once in 10\u00a0years. The safety factors in Book II (Plumbing Systems) of this Code will probably reduce the \nfrequency to a reasonable value and, in\u00a0addition, the occasional failure of a roof drainage system will not be particularly serious in \nmost cases.\nThe rainfall intensity values were updated for the 2012\u00a0edition of the Code using observations of annual maximum 15-minute \nrainfall amounts from 485\u00a0stations with 10\u00a0or\u00a0more years of record, including data up to 2007 for some stations. Ten-year return \nperiod values \u2013 the 15-minute rainfall having a probability of 1-in-10 of being exceeded in any year \u2013 were calculated by fitting \nthe annual maximum values to the Gumbel extreme value distribution(4) using the method of moments. The updated values are \ncompiled from the most recent short-duration rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) graphs and tables available from \nEnvironment Canada.\nIt is very difficult to estimate the pattern of rainfall intensity in mountainous areas, where precipitation is extremely variable and \nrainfall intensity can be much greater than in other types of areas. Many of the observations for these areas were taken at locations \nin valley bottoms or in extensive, fairly level areas.\nOne-Day Rainfall\nIf for any reason a roof drainage system becomes ineffective, the accumulation of rainwater may be great enough in some cases to \ncause a significant increase in the load on the roof. In previous editions of this information, it had been common practice to use \nthe maximum one-day rainfall ever observed for estimating the additional load. Since the length of record for weather stations is \nquite variable, the maximum one-day rainfall amounts in previous editions often reflected the variable length of record at nearby \nstations as much as the climatology. As a result, the maximum values often differed greatly within relatively small areas where little \ndifference should be expected. The current values have been standardized to represent the one-day rainfall amounts that have \n1\u00a0chance in\u00a050 of being exceeded in any one year or the 1-in-50-year return value one-day rainfalls.\nThe one-day rainfall values were updated using daily rainfall observations from more than 3 500 stations with 10\u00a0years or more of \nrecord, including data up to 2008 for some stations. The 50-year return period values were calculated by fitting the annual \nmaximum one-day rainfall observations to the Gumbel extreme value distribution using the method of moments.(4)\nRainfall frequency observations can vary considerably over time and space. This is especially true for mountainous areas, where \nelevation effects can be significant. In other areas, small-scale intense storms or local influences can produce significant spatial \nvariability in the data. As a result, the analysis incorporates some spatial smoothing.\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B\nBritish Columbia Building Code",

Although the values provided in the Table give a good indication of \nthe average conditions within a particular region, some caution must be exercised when applying them to a locality that is outside \nthe region where the weather station is located.\nMI is calculated from a wetting index (WI) and a drying index (DI).\nWetting Index (WI)\nTo define, quantitatively, the rainwater load on a wall, wind speed and wind direction have to be taken into consideration in \naddition to rainfall, along with factors that can affect exposure, such as nearby buildings, vegetation and topography. Quantitative \ndetermination of load, including wind speed and wind direction, can be done. However, due to limited weather data, it is not \ncurrently possible to provide this information for most of the locations identified in the Table.\nThis lack of information, however, has been shown to be non-critical for the purpose of classifying locations in terms of severity of \nrain load. The results of the research indicated that simple annual rainfall is as good an indicator as any for describing rainwater \nload. That is to say, for Canadian locations, and especially once drying is accounted for, the additional sensitivity provided by \nhourly directional rainfall values does not have a significant effect on the order in which locations appear when listed from wet \nto dry.\nConsequently, the wetting index (WI) is based on annual rainfall and is normalized based on 1 000 mm.\nDrying Index (DI)\nTemperature and relative humidity together define the drying capacity of ambient air. Based on simple psychrometrics, values \nwere derived for the locations listed in the Table using annual average drying capacity normalized based on the drying capacity at \nLytton, B.C. The resultant values are referred to as drying indices (DI).\nDetermination of Moisture Index (MI)\nThe relationship between WI and DI to correctly define moisture loading on a wall is not known. The MI\u00a0values provided in the \nTable are based on the root mean square values of WI and 1-DI, with those values equally weighted. This is illustrated in \nFigure\u00a0C-1. The resultant MI\u00a0values are sufficiently consistent with industry\u2019s understanding of climate severity with respect to \nmoisture loading as to allow limits to be identified for the purpose of specifying where additional protection from precipitation \nis required.\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nDivision B\nFigure C-1\nDerivation of moisture index (MI) based on normalized values for wetting index (WI) and drying index (DI)\nNote to Figure\u00a0C-1:\n(1) MI equals the hypotenuse of the triangle defined by WIN and 1-DIN\nDriving Rain Wind Pressure (DRWP)\nThe presence of rainwater on the face of a building, with or without wind, must be addressed in the design and construction of \nthe building envelope so as to minimize the entry of water into the assembly. Wind pressure on the windward faces of a building \nwill promote the flow of water through any open joints or cracks in the facade.\nDriving rain wind pressure (DRWP) is the wind load that is coincident with rain, measured or calculated at a height of 10\u00a0m. \nThe values provided in the Table represent the loads for which there is 1\u00a0chance in\u00a05 of being reached or exceeded in any one year, \nor a probability of 20% within any one year. Approximate adjustments for height can be made using the values for Ce given in \nSentence\u00a04.1.7.3.(5) as a multiplier.\nBecause of inaccuracies in developing the DRWP values related to the averaging of extreme wind pressures, the actual heights of \nrecording anemometers, and the use of estimated rather than measured rainfall values, the values are considered to be higher than \nactual loads.(8)(9) Thus the actual probability of reaching or exceeding the DRWP in a particular location is less than 20% per\u00a0year \nand these values can be considered to be conservative.\nDRWP can be used to determine the height to which wind will drive rainwater up enclosed vertical conduits. This provides a \nconservative estimate of the height needed for fins in window extrusions and end dams on flashings to control water ingress. \nThis\u00a0height can be calculated as:\nNote that the pressure difference across the building envelope may be augmented by internal pressures induced in the building \ninterior by the wind.

Some flexible structures, such as tall buildings, slender towers and bridges, also need to be designed to minimize excessive \nwind-induced oscillations or vibrations.\nAt any time, the wind acting upon a structure can be treated as a mean or time-averaged component and as a gust or unsteady \ncomponent. For a small structure, which is completely enveloped by wind gusts, it is only the peak gust velocity that needs to be \nconsidered. For a large structure, the wind gusts are not well correlated over its different parts and the effects of individual gusts \nbecome less significant. The \u201cUser\u2019s Guide \u2013 NBC 2015, Structural Commentaries (Part\u00a04 of Division\u00a0B)\u201d evaluates the mean \npressure acting on a structure, provide appropriate adjustments for building height and exposure and for the influence of the \nsurrounding terrain and topography (including wind speed-up for\u00a0hills), and then incorporate the effects of wind gusts by means \nof the gust factor, which varies according to the type of structure and the size of the area over which the pressure acts.\nThe wind speeds and corresponding velocity pressures used in the Code are regionally representative or reference values. \nThe\u00a0reference wind speeds are nominal one-hour averages of wind speeds representative of the 10\u00a0m height in flat open terrain \ncorresponding to Exposure A or open terrain in the terminology of the \u201cUser\u2019s Guide \u2013 NBC 2015, Structural Commentaries \n(Part\u00a04 of Division\u00a0B).\u201d The reference wind speeds and wind velocity pressures are based on long-term wind records observed at a \nlarge number of weather stations across Canada.\nReference wind velocity pressures in previous versions of the Code since\u00a01961 were based mostly on records of hourly averaged \nwind speeds (i.e. the number of miles of wind passing an anemometer in an\u00a0hour) from over\u00a0100 stations with 10 to 22\u00a0years of \nobservations ending in the 1950s. The wind pressure values derived from these measurements represented true hourly wind \npressures.\nThe reference wind velocity pressures were reviewed and updated for the 2012\u00a0edition of the Code. The primary data set used for \nthe analysis comprised wind records compiled from about 135\u00a0stations with hourly averaged wind speeds and from 465\u00a0stations \nwith aviation (one- or two-minute average) speeds or surface weather (ten-minute average) speeds observed once per hour at the \ntop of the hour; the periods of record used ranged from 10\u00a0to\u00a054\u00a0years. In addition, peak wind gust records from 400\u00a0stations \nwith periods of record ranging from 10 to 43\u00a0years were used. Peak wind gusts (gust durations of approximately 3\u00a0to\u00a07\u00a0seconds) \nwere used to supplement the primary once-per-hour observations in the analysis.\nSeveral steps were involved in updating the reference wind values. Where needed, speeds were adjusted to represent the standard \nanemometer height above ground of 10\u00a0m. The data from years when the anemometer at a station was installed on the top of a \nlighthouse or building were eliminated from the analysis since it is impractical to adjust for the effects of wind flow over the \nstructure. (Most anemometers were moved to 10\u00a0m towers by the 1960s.) Wind speeds of the various observation types \u2013 hourly \naveraged, aviation, surface weather and peak wind gust \u2013 were adjusted to account for different measure durations to represent a \none-hour averaging period and to account for differences in the surface roughness of flat open terrain at observing stations.\nThe annual maximum wind speed data was fitted to the Gumbel distribution using the method of moments(4) to calculate hourly \nwind speeds having the annual probability of occurrence of 1-in-10 and 1-in-50 (10-year and 50-year return periods). The values \nwere plotted on maps, then analyzed and abstracted for the locations in Table\u00a0C-2.\nThe wind velocity pressures, q, were calculated in Pascals using the following equation:\nwhere \uf072 is an average air density for the windy months of the year and V is wind speed in metres per second. While air density \ndepends on both air temperature and atmospheric pressure, the density of dry air at 0\u00b0C and standard atmospheric pressure of \n1.2929\u00a0kg/m3 was used as an average value for the wind",
  "ed for the locations in Table\u00a0C-2.\nThe wind velocity pressures, q, were calculated in Pascals using the following equation:\nwhere \uf072 is an average air density for the windy months of the year and V is wind speed in metres per second. While air density \ndepends on both air temperature and atmospheric pressure, the density of dry air at 0\u00b0C and standard atmospheric pressure of \n1.2929\u00a0kg/m3 was used as an average value for the wind pressure calculations. As explained by Boyd(10), this value is within 10% of \nthe monthly average air densities for most of Canada in the windy part of the year.\nAs a result of the updating procedure, the 1-in-50 reference wind velocity pressures remain unchanged for most of the locations \nlisted in Table\u00a0C-2; both increases and decreases were noted for the remaining locations. Many of the decreases resulted from the \nfact that anemometers at most of the stations used in the previous analysis were installed on lighthouses, airport hangers and other \nstructures. Wind speeds on the tops of buildings are often much higher compared to those registered by a standard 10\u00a0m tower. \nEliminating anemometer data recorded on the tops of buildings from the analysis resulted in lower values at several locations.\nHourly wind speeds that have 1\u00a0chance in\u00a010 and 50(1) of being exceeded in any one year were analyzed using the Gumbel \nextreme value distribution fitted using the method of moments with correction for sample size. Values of the 1-in-30-year wind \nspeeds for locations in the Table were estimated from a mapping analysis of wind speeds. The 1-in-10- and 1-in-50-year speeds \nwere then computed from the 1-in-30-year speeds using a map of the dispersion parameter that occurs in the Gumbel analysis.(4)\nq \u0002 \u0002\n\u0004\nV2\nEffective December 10, 2018 to December 11, 2019\nClimatic and Seismic Information for Building Design in Canada\nDivision B \u2013 Appendix C\nBritish Columbia Building Code 2018\nDivision B\nTable\u00a0C-1 has been arranged to give pressures to the nearest one-hundredth of a kPa and their corresponding wind speeds. \nThe\u00a0value of \u201cq\u201d in kPa is assumed to be equal to 0.00064645 V2, where V is given in m/s.\n(1) Wind speeds that have a one-in-\u201cn\u201d-year chance of being exceeded in any year can be computed from the one-in-10 and one-in-50 \nreturn values in the Table using the following equation: \nTable C-1\nWind Speeds\nq\nV\nq\nV\nq\nV\nq\nV\nkPa\nm/s\nkPa\nm/s\nkPa\nm/s\nkPa\nm/s\n0.15\n15.2\n0.53\n28.6\n0.91\n37.5\n1.29\n44.7\n0.16\n15.7\n0.54\n28.9\n0.92\n37.7\n1.30\n44.8\n0.17\n16.2\n0.55\n29.2\n0.93\n37.9\n1.31\n45.0\n0.18\n16.7\n0.56\n29.4\n0.94\n38.1\n1.32\n45.2\n0.19\n17.1\n0.57\n29.7\n0.95\n38.3\n1.33\n45.4\n0.20\n17.6\n0.58\n30.0\n0.96\n38.5\n1.34\n45.5\n0.21\n18.0\n0.59\n30.2\n0.97\n38.7\n1.35\n45.7\n0.22\n18.4\n0.60\n30.5\n0.98\n38.9\n1.36\n45.9\n0.23\n18.9\n0.61\n30.7\n0.99\n39.1\n1.37\n46.0\n0.24\n19.3\n0.62\n31.0\n1.00\n39.3\n1.38\n46.2\n0.25\n19.7\n0.63\n31.2\n1.01\n39.5\n1.39\n46.4\n0.26\n20.1\n0.64\n31.5\n1.02\n39.7\n1.40\n46.5\n0.27\n20.4\n0.65\n31.7\n1.03\n39.9\n1.41\n46.7\n0.28\n20.8\n0.66\n32.0\n1.04\n40.1\n1.42\n46.9\n0.29\n21.2\n0.67\n32.2\n1.05\n40.3\n1.43\n47.0\n0.30\n21.5\n0.68\n32.4\n1.06\n40.5\n1.44\n47.2\n0.31\n21.9\n0.69\n32.7\n1.07\n40.7\n1.45\n47.4\n0.32\n22.2\n0.70\n32.9\n1.08\n40.9\n1.46\n47.5\n0.33\n22.6\n0.71\n33.",

The six spectral \nparameters are deemed sufficient to define spectra closely matching the shape of the Uniform Hazard Spectra (UHS). \nHazard\u00a0values are mean values based on a statistical analysis of the earthquakes that have been experienced in Canada and adjacent \nregions.(11) The seismic hazard values were updated for this edition of the Code by updating the earthquake catalogue, revising the \nseismic source zones, adding fault sources for the Cascadia subduction zone and certain other active faults, revising the Ground \nMotion Prediction Equations (GMPEs),(12) and using a probabilistic model to combine all inputs.\nFor most locations, the new GMPEs are the most significant reason for changes in the hazard results from the 2012 Code. \nOne\u00a0exception is for areas of western Canada for which adding the Cascadia subduction source contribution to the model \nprobabilistically causes the most significant change. For locations in western Canada, the seismic hazard at long periods has \nincreased significantly for areas affected by the Cascadia interface. For other areas, the explicit inclusion of fault sources, such as \nthose in Haida Gwaii, has also affected the estimated hazard.\nFurther details regarding the representation of seismic hazard can be found in the Commentary on Design for Seismic Effects in \nthe \u201cUser\u2019s Guide \u2013 NBC 2015, Structural Commentaries (Part 4 of Division B).\u201d\nWhistler\n665\n-17\n-20\n30\n20\n4180\n10\n85\n845\n0.99\n1215\n160\n9.5\n0.9\n0.25\n0.32\nWhite Rock\n30\n-5\n-7\n25\n20\n2620\n10\n80\n1065\n1.17\n1100\n160\n2.0\n0.2\n0.34\n0.44\nWilliams Lake\n615\n-30\n-33\n29\n17\n4400\n10\n48\n350\n0.47\n425\n80\n2.4\n0.2\n0.27\n0.35\nYoubou\n200\n-5\n-8\n31\n19\n3050\n10\n161\n2000\n2.09\n2100\n200\n3.5\n0.7\n0.",
