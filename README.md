## Analogy of future human–AI collaborations

Traditional practice relies on long apprenticeships, with senior engineers transferring expertise to junior engineers through mentorship and problem solving. In contrast, LLM-based multi-agent systems instantiate scalable junior engineer agents that inherit workflows, perform specialized tasks, and coordinate under senior engineers' oversight. As these systems evolve toward self-planning and adaptive learning, fully agentic hierarchies—with senior engineer agent directing junior engineer agents—could transform engineering into a continuously improving, highly efficient practice.
